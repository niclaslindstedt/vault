# Contributing to vault

Thanks for your interest! This document describes how to set up a dev
environment, the conventions we follow, and how to get a change merged.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js ≥ 22 (CI pins 24 — see `.nvmrc`), npm ≥ 10
- A GitHub personal access token with `read:packages` in `~/.npmrc` — the
  `@niclaslindstedt/oss-framework` dependency resolves from GitHub Packages
  (see the README's Install section)

## Getting the source

```sh
git clone https://github.com/niclaslindstedt/vault.git
cd vault
npm install
```

## Build, test, lint

```sh
make build
make test
make lint
make fmt-check
```

## Development workflow

1. Fork the repo.
2. Create a topic branch: `git checkout -b feat/<slug>` or `fix/<slug>`.
3. Make focused commits using [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):
   ```
   <type>(<scope>): <summary>
   ```
   Types: `feat`, `fix`, `perf`, `docs`, `test`, `refactor`, `chore`, `ci`,
   `build`, `style`. Breaking changes: `<type>!:` or `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer.
4. If the change is user-visible, add a changelog fragment under
   `.changes/unreleased/` (CI enforces this via the `changeset` job):

   ```
   .changes/unreleased/$(date +%s)-short-slug.md
   ---
   type: Added        # Added | Changed | Fixed | Removed | Security | Deprecated
   breaking: true     # optional — forces a major release
   ---

   One line users will read in the changelog.
   ```

   Pure refactors, CI/build tweaks, and docs-only PRs are exempt (skip-list in
   `scripts/release/check-changeset.mjs`); or label the PR `no-changelog` to opt
   out. The Release workflow collates these into `CHANGELOG.md` and derives the
   semver bump — run `make bump` to preview it.

5. Open a PR. The **PR title** must be conventional-commit format because we
   squash-merge and that title becomes the commit message on `main`.
6. CI must be green and at least one reviewer must approve.

## Tests

Tests live in `tests/` with a `_test` suffix (OSS_SPEC §20.2) and cover the
pure domain modules — categories/folders, tags, documents, search (sidecars
included), scanner geometry, migrations. Run one file with `npx vitest run tests/search_test.ts`. UI changes
should keep the boot smoke path working: `npm run build && npm run preview`
and click through creating a document.

## Documentation

If your change touches user-visible behavior, update the relevant `docs/`
topic and the README quick start. See `AGENTS.md` for the full sync table.

## Governance

This is a single-maintainer project: [@niclaslindstedt](https://github.com/niclaslindstedt)
merges PRs and makes final decisions. Disputes are resolved in the PR thread;
sustained, high-quality contributions are the path to being invited as a
maintainer. If the project is abandoned, the license permits noncommercial
forks — open an issue first so a successor can be blessed.
